{"subreddit": "science", "body": "Just want to point out that in Earth Science an ice age is any period in which theres ice at the poles year round. Meaning we are still in an ice age, the Late Cenozoic ice age which kicked off about 33.9 million years ago with glaciation over Antarctica (as pointed out below this is distinguished from the Quaternary Ice age around 2.58 million years ago, which marks glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere). Within any ice age (but most especially this current one because of its recency) there are observed glacial periods, marked by cooler temperatures and expanding ice sheets and interglacial cycles which as the name suggests is characterized by waqrming temperatures and retreating ice sheets.", "score": 1}
